## Professional Work
My speciality is front-end web development, interning at Torchbox taught me professional standards of web production quality. Outside of developing my own front-end components for sites, I used Google Lighthouse with other web-performance tools to report on website performance and recommend actions to improve site performance.

## Academics
My bachelor's degree is split between conventional computer science units and innovation units. Innovation is taught as a team-focused multidisciplinary exploration of human centred design, consultancy and start-up entrepreneurship. Studying innovation, I consulted for a multinational telecommunications company on quantum security, helped a local hackspace make their space more welcoming and interviewed film production professionals to validate a start-up pitch.
