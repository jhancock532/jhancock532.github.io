# jhancock532.github.io

Welcome to my personal website.
This is the final project of a month dedicated to improving my web development knowledge. The full journey is documented on my [January Everydays](https://jhancock532.github.io/everydays/) blog.

This site uses dat.GUI and p5.js for the particle effects and particle editor, hidden in the top right corner.

I coded two simple JavaScript classes for this project, `Particle` and `Particle System`. If you'd like to create a particle system using a similar system, I've created [a template on CodePen](https://codepen.io/jhancock532/pen/MZZMVK) you can build from.

I avoided using Bootstrap and jQuery, as I was already using two libraries and didn't want the project get any more bloated for a simple one page site. This limitation helped me learn more about CSS and animations.
